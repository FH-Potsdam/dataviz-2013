2,"eucrite","Eucrites are the most abundant type of basaltic achondrite, linked by geochemical traits such as oxygen isotopic ratios and certain elemental ratios, of which Fe/Mn is the most widely cited. The main minerals in eucrites are Fe-rich pyroxene and Na-poor plagioclase. The eucrites are strongly linked with the diogenites and howardites; the three groups are collectively known as HED meteorites and may come from asteroid 4 Vesta."
3,"ordinary chondrite","A major class of chondrites, distinguished by sub-solar Mg/Si and refractory/Si ratios, oxygen isotope compositions that plot above the terrestrial fractionation line, and a large volume percentage of chondrules, with only 10-15 vol% fine-grained matrix."
4,"L group","The low-iron (L) chemical group of ordinary chondrites, distinguished by their relatively low siderophile element content, moderate sized chondrules (~0.7 mm), and oxygen isotope compositions that intermediate between H and LL group ordinary chondrites."
5,"type 3","Designates chondrites that are characterized by abundant chondrules, low degrees of aqueous alteration, and unequilibrated mineral assemblages.  Many of the low-Ca pyroxene grains are monoclinic and exhibit polysynthetic twinning.  The type 3 chondrites may be divided into subtypes ranging from 3.00 (least metamorphosed) to 3.9 (nearly metamorphosed to type 4 levels).  If primary igneous glass occurs in the chondrules, it belongs to type 3."
6,"type 4","Designates chondrites that are characterized by abundant chondrules, and have been metamorphosed under conditions sufficient to homogenize olivine compositions and recrystallize fine-grained matrix.  Some of the low-Ca pyroxene grains may be monoclinic and exhibit polysynthetic twinning.  Primary igneous chondrule glass is absent."

The CBb subgroup contains small chondrules (0.2 - 1 mm), abundant metal (~70 vol%), and some refractory inclusions.  It is uncertain whether any or all CB meteorites are true chondrites, as they may have formed slightly later in solar system history."
37,"ureilite","Ureilites, named after the Novo-Urei, Russia, fall of 1886, are ultramafic achondrites that contain interstitial carbon as graphite or diamond.  The majority consist of olivine + uninverted pigeonite.  In a few, the pyroxene is augite and/or orthopyroxene instead.

46,"CH group","The high-metal (CH) chemical group of carbonaceous chondrites, similar to Allan Hills 85085; CH chondrites have tiny chondrules and refractory inclusions (~0.02 mm), abundant metal (~20 vol%), no fine-grained matrix except as xenolithic clasts, and rare sulfides consistent with overall low volatile element contents.  It is uncertain whether members of the group are true chondrites, as they may have formed slightly later in solar system history."
47,"brachinite","Brachinites, named after Brachina, a meteorite found in Australia in 1974, are olivine-rich achondrites that are relatively close to chondrites in many compositional properties, and so are frequently considered to be primitive achondrites. Their true origin is still an open question and not all brachinites may share the same origin."
